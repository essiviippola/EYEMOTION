# EYEMOTION

## Introduction

Eyes are a window to our innermost feelings â€” they can speak volumes without saying a word. Yet, a lot is going on behind them and unravelling the intricacies of one's mental well-being can be overwhelming. 

**EYEMOTION** harnesses the power of emotional AI to offer personalized insights into mental health patterns. Integrated into smart glasses, EYEMOTION decodes unique emotional patterns solely through the eyes. This is achieved by leveraging the latest advancements in deep learning and utilizing accessible video and audio data during the training process.
